I'm currently a student and a self-taught game developer. I am working on some side projects, learning a couple of new dishes, and trying to wrap my head around life.  

 <br/>üî≠ &nbsp;I‚Äôm slowly working on [Tandem Workshop](https://github.com/BugsAreFeatures/tandem-workshop)
 <br/>üå± &nbsp;I‚Äôm currently learning Unity, C#
 <br/>üí¨ &nbsp;I'm always looking for new things to learn or projects to build!

  <summary><b>‚ú®&nbsp;&nbsp;About&nbsp;Me</b></summary>
  <br/>

I am a Self-Taught game developer with 2+ years of experience in developing C# Applications and Games using the Unity Engine.

### My Favourites
Most of my projects are released on GitHub:
- [Tandem Workshop](https://github.com/BugsAreFeatures/tandem-workshop) - This project is a fun little tool-game thing, you can create bikes with lots of wheels, seats, and colours or just make the weirdest funniest looking bike that you can, there is no objective but you can save an orbiting gif of your bike to share with friends.
- [Graphing Paper](https://github.com/BugsAreFeatures/graphing-paper) - A minimal drawing app with some questionable functionality, A lot of the tools have extra unique functions aside from the base tool, such as easily replacing or ignoring colours with the brush, erasing and fill tools, creating barcode-like patterns with the select tools & a lot more, I've just added in features that I think could be useful to people with a lot more skill than me.
- [Soda Rocket](https://github.com/BugsAreFeatures/soda-rocket) A simple Game/App launcher to Organize your Games, Apps, and Tools both on your device or the internet.
- [Acerage](https://github.com/BugsAreFeatures/acerage) - A VR-camping experience, users can forage & farm for crops, hunt for food, and build camp-fire huts and traps.

[‚è© &nbsp; and many more](https://github.com/BugsAreFeatures?tab=repositories)

In my downtime I enjoy learning new skills, listening to music and trying to organize all my side projects, I enjoy making small projects based on things I am interested in at the moment, whether that be rock climbing, Farming, Drawing or even Mechanics & Features such as Inverse-Kinematics or Scaleable-Inventory-Systems. Most of my projects end up on Github but I often use 3rd-party visual assets as I am no artist, replacing these assets once the project is completed can take me a while before it can be shared on GitHub.

I started my journey in late 2019 to early 2020 after playing [Hollow Knight](https://www.hollowknight.com), I had heard of Unity and thought it would be nice to be able to create my own games one day but always thought that Indie games had to be small and poorly-produced, but after learning about how Hollow Knight came to be I wanted nothing more to make my mark on the gaming world, I, of course, didn't get very far into making my dream-game before realising this was way too much for me, but after a lot of trial and error I've started to build up my skills and ability to scope and complete projects.
